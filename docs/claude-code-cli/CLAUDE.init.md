# Claude Code CLI Initialization

## Overview

This document provides a step-by-step guide to initialize the Claude Code CLI, which is a command-line interface for interacting with the Claude AI model.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
- Install the required Python packages using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install claude-cli
  ```

- Ensure you have access to the Claude API and have your API key ready.

## Initialization Steps

1. **Fetch the Latest Claude Models List**:
   Use the provided PowerShell module to fetch the latest available Claude models directly from Anthropic:

   ```powershell
   Import-Module ./scripts/Get-ProviderModels.psm1
   Get-ProviderModels -Provider "claude" -OutputPath "./configs/claude_models.yaml"
   ```

   This will create a `claude_models.yaml` file in your `configs` directory, listing all supported Claude models and their descriptions. You can use this file to power autocomplete features in your CLI tools or Jupyter notebooks.

2. **Create a Configuration File**:
   Create a YAML configuration file for Claude CLI in the `configs` directory. This file will store your API key and other configurations.

   Example `configs/claude_config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   api_key: YOUR_CLAUDE_API_KEY
   api_url: https://api.anthropic.com/v1
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   claude --help
   ```

   This should display the help message for the CLI, confirming that it is installed correctly.

4. **Test API Access**:
   Run a simple command to verify your API key and connection:

   ```bash
   claude chat --message "Hello, Claude!"
   ```

   If configured correctly, you should receive a response from Claude.

5. **(Optional) Set Environment Variables**:
   You can also set your API key as an environment variable instead of using a config file:

   ```bash
   export CLAUDE_API_KEY=YOUR_CLAUDE_API_KEY
   ```

   Add this line to your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `profile.ps1` for PowerShell) to make it persistent.

## CLI Setup Wizard

To streamline the setup process for your project, the CLI setup wizard includes the following steps:

1. **Install Required Python Packages**:
   The wizard will automatically install the necessary Python packages, including:

   - `claude-cli`
   - `elevenlabs`

   Example command:

   ```bash
   pip install claude-cli elevenlabs
   ```

2. **Fetch the Latest Claude Models**:
   The wizard uses the `Get-ProviderModels.psm1` script to fetch the latest Claude models and generate a `claude_models.yaml` file.

3. **Configure ElevenLabs**:
   The wizard will prompt you to enter your ElevenLabs API key and save it to the `configs/elevenlabs_config.yaml` file.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   The wizard will verify that all tools and configurations are set up correctly by running test commands for both Claude CLI and ElevenLabs.

5. **Generate Example Scripts**:
   Example scripts for using Claude CLI and ElevenLabs will be generated in the `scripts/` directory.

## Additional Configuration Files

- **AI Tools Configuration**:
  The `configs/ai-tools.yaml` file lists all AI coding assistant CLI tools used in the project, including their versions, descriptions, and associated configuration files.

- **Code Stack Configuration**:
  The `configs/code-stack.yaml` file documents the programming languages, libraries, and tools used in the project.

- **Operating Systems Support**:
  The `configs/os-support.yaml` file specifies supported operating systems and their dependencies.

## Usage Examples

- **Start a Chat Session**:

  ```bash
  claude chat
  ```

  This will start an interactive chat session with Claude.

- **Send a One-off Message**:

  ```bash
  claude chat --message "Summarize the latest AI research trends."
  ```

- **Specify a Different Config File**:

  ```bash
  claude --config /path/to/your/claude_config.json chat --message "Hello!"
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Command Not Found**: Ensure your Python scripts directory is in your `PATH`.
- **Invalid API Key**: Double-check your API key in the config file or environment variable.
- **Network Issues**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection and the API URL is correct.

## Integration with SuperClaude

SuperClaude is a development framework that enhances Claude Code with specialized commands, cognitive personas, and development methodologies. It provides a structured approach to using Claude Code effectively.

### Installation

To install SuperClaude, clone the repository and run the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NomenAK/SuperClaude.git
cd SuperClaude
./install.sh
```

By default, SuperClaude installs to `~/.claude/`. You can customize the installation directory using:

```bash
./install.sh --dir /path/to/custom/location
```

### Key Features

- **19 Specialized Commands**: Covering the entire development lifecycle, from building to deployment.
- **9 Cognitive Personas**: Domain-specific approaches for tasks like architecture, security, and performance.
- **Token Optimization**: Includes compression options and caching mechanisms.
- **MCP Integration**: Supports Context7, Sequential, Magic, and Puppeteer for advanced workflows.

### Example Workflows

- **Full-Stack Feature Development**:

  ```bash
  /build --react --magic --watch --persona-frontend
  /test --coverage --e2e --strict --persona-qa
  /scan --validate --deps --persona-security
  ```
